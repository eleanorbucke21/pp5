# Agile Methodology
## **GitHub Projects**

Find out project board here:
* [project board]()

GitHub Projects was used to manage the development of the site. It helped our team to break down large issues into smaller issues and how these fit into the overall goals of implementing specific features we wanted for the site. We also used labels to distinguish the issues which are part of the setup, of the documentation, the must haves and the enhancements, and the required validations.

<br>

## <strong>Testing</strong>

## <strong>Deployment</strong>
 
 ### <u>Github</u>

This website was published using GitHub Pages.

- Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.

- Navigate to your repositories and find the project you want to deploy

- Under the name of your chosen Repository you will see a ribbon of selections, click on 'Settings' located on the right hand side.

- Scroll down till you see 'Pages' heading on the left hand side

- Under the 'Source' click on the dropdown and select 'master' or 'main' branch and click save

- The page will reload and you'll see the link of your published page displayed under 'GitHub' pages.

- It takes a few minutes for the site to be published, wait until the background of your link changes to a green color before trying to open it.

- Congratulations you have deployed your project!
 
 This website was written on Gitpod.
 
 ### <u>Gitpod</u>
 - Navigate to [Gitpod] through [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/).
- In the browser’s address bar, prefix the entire URL with gitpod.io/# and press Enter.
- For example, gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website
- We recommend you install the Gitpod browser extension to make this a one-click operation.
- Sign in with one of the listed providers and let the workspace start up.
- Congratulations, you have started your first of many ephemeral developer environments!

### <u>ElephantSQL</u>
This website was hosted on elephantSQL.
- Create a new app.
- Add a name of the app. This name should be a name that helps you identify which application the instance is used by.
- Select a plan: The plan you would like to have. I used <strong>Tiny Turtle Plan</strong>
- Select tags: I left this field blank.
- Select Region: I selected EU-West-1 (IRELAND).
- Then click review.
- Check that the details are correct tthen click <strong>"Create Instance"</strong>.
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
- In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL which will then be put into the envy.py file in gitpod.

### <u>Heroku</u>
This website was deployed on Heroku. 
* When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`

* You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
* If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
* Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
