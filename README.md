- Scroll down till you see 'Pages' heading on the left hand side

- Under the 'Source' click on the dropdown and select 'master' or 'main' branch and click save

- The page will reload and you'll see the link of your published page displayed under 'GitHub' pages.

- It takes a few minutes for the site to be published, wait until the background of your link changes to a green color before trying to open it.

- Congratulations you have deployed your project!
 
 This website was written on Gitpod.
 
 ### <u>Gitpod</u>
 - Navigate to [Gitpod] through [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/).
- In the browser’s address bar, prefix the entire URL with gitpod.io/# and press Enter.
- For example, gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website
- We recommend you install the Gitpod browser extension to make this a one-click operation.

- Congratulations, you have started your first of many ephemeral developer environments!

### <u>ElephantSQL</u>
This website was hosted on elephantSQL.
- Create a new app.
- Add a name of the app. This name should be a name that helps you identify which application the instance is used by.
- Select a plan: The plan you would like to have. I used <strong>Tiny Turtle Plan</strong>
- Select tags: I left this field blank.
- Select Region: I selected EU-West-1 (IRELAND).
- Then click review.
- Check that the details are correct tthen click <strong>"Create Instance"</strong>.
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
- In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL which will then be put into the envy.py file in gitpod.

### <u>Heroku</u>
This website was deployed on Heroku. 
* When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`

* You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
* If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
* Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
